  Example schema - for MythTV

  Typical lines:

    Mar 24 02:50:07 hpserv mythbackend: mythbackend[3083]: I ProcessRequest mainserver.cpp:1420 (HandleAnnounce) MainServer::ANN Monitor
    Mar 24 02:50:07 hpserv mythbackend: mythbackend[3083]: I ProcessRequest mainserver.cpp:1422 (HandleAnnounce) adding: hpserv as a client( events : 0 )

  Fixed fields (denoted by braces):
  # {date} {machine} {module}: {module}[{process}]: {category} {thread} {emitter} ({function}) {text}

  Notes:
    The {thread} field sometimes has a suffix of the form "_number"
    The {function} field can include a ~

    regex can be used to override the separator based log line description; this
    is not preferred though, as the regex's are relatively slow to execute:
    
    allowing for a "~" character in the function name required changing (\w+) to
    ([~\w]+); which increased execution time from ~10us per line, to 40us per line;
    switching to ((~|\w)+) was ~80 us per line
    
    for comparison, using separators (and no regex) was 1.6 us per line.
    
    <regex>(.{15}) (\w+) (\w+): (\w+)\[(\d+)\]: (\w+) ([[:alnum:]]+)\w* [\w/]+\.\w+:\d+ \(([~\w]+)\) </regex>

    each field is described by the following attributes

    type: description of the type (e.g. "uint08"), mainly used by the indexer
     see the documentation for the full list

    name: the field's name; used in the UI and by the filter language

    separator: character sequence following the field, and separating it from
     the next field

    count: (optional) number of repeats of "separator", use when the field contains
     the same text as the separator
     
    minwidth: (optional) minimum number of characters in the field, again, for use
     when the field contains the same text as the separator

    <!--
    (Optional) The indexer has an implementation limit for the maximum text length
    for all of the field items on a log file line. This is either "8" (maximum text
    length is 256 bytes) or "16" (maximum text length is 64KB). Note that this
    restriction does *not* include the non-field text part of a log line - which
    can be of arbitrary length. Where omitted, the value is assumed to be "8"

    <!--
    Where an 'emitter' field is defined, the following extractors should be supplied to allow
    the field to be interpreted:
    
    source_subst: (0 or more) textual substitution to make to the emitter text before running
    the extractors, e.g.

      <source_subst from="re_match_text" to="plain_with_text"/>
    
    source_path: Python regular expression to extract a source path from the emitter field, e.g.
    
      <source_path>([^:]*)</source_path>
    
    source_line: Python regular expression to extract a source line number from the emitter field, e.g.
    
      <source_line>:(\d*)</source_line>
    
    In each case, the regular expression should contain a single parenthesized result group,
    which corresponds to the text to extract
    -->
    <source_path>([^:]*)</source_path>
    <source_line>:(\d*)</source_line>


    <!--
    (Optional) Where an 'emitter' field is defined, the schema can define a channel ID, which
    determines the channel to which source code events are sent. If not specified, notices
    are sent to the default channel.
