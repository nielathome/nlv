  -->

  <formatter name="MythTV" guid="5504661D-DCE8-48F4-9CCC-7875244DA32B">

    <styleset>C8B802B0-FE05-4F38-A20D-E9E3573B8BDD</styleset>

    <!--
    A formatter is a collection of formats. A format is described by a regex and a list
    of style names. Display text is matched against the regex, and successive matches are
    styled according to the style list. Note the user will select the styleset to preference.
    Formats are applied in the order below, hence the last format takes precedence.
    -->

    <format>
      <regex>(events:)\s+(\d+)</regex>
      <style>fieldtext</style>
      <style>strongvalue</style>
    </format>

    <format>
      <regex>Scheduled\s+(\d+)</regex>
      <style>value</style>
    </format>

    <format>
      <regex>(\+)</regex>
      <style>dimmed</style>
